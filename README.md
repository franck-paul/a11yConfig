## Notes about enabling reinforced/inverted constrast in Dotclear administration

* It's recommended to disable the syntax highlighting for the theme editor (see "My preferences" > "My options" > "Other options" > "Syntax highlighting") otherwise the selected text and the cursor will not be visible.
* This option will not be applied to CKEditor; you should switch back to the Legacy Editor if necessary for HTML edition (see "My preferences" > "My options" > "Edition").
* If this mode the toolbar buttons of the Legacy editor will be replaced by their textual equivalent.
